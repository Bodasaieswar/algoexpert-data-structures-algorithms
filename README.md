**Description:** This is a collection of all AlgoExpert Coding Interview questions that are currently available on the platform. There are solutions for each problem statement including time and space complexity. Since AlgoExpert is a paid platform, everyone doesn't have access to it or can't afford to. I hope this helps everyone to access the content and improve their problem solving skills.

#

**Solutions:**
The solutions are provided in Python.

**Questions:**
You can get the questions here: [AlgoExpert Questions](https://imgur.com/a/p9Phdft) 
<br/>
The questions are not ordered so you might need to search for a bit.

### :zap: HOW TO 

You can visit this page and download the latest Python release version: [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
<br/>
After you complete the download and install, you can run any solution by writing a main providing the required inputs.

For example, in case of 'Two number sum' problem:
```python
if __name__=='__main__':
	print(twoNumberSum([1,3,4,5], 7))
```

The code can be executed like this:
```bash
python easy/twoNumberSum.py
```
